# Next.js Project Setup and Basics.

# Project Description
SoloForge: Mastering Project Autonomy is a foundational project designed to introduce developers to building modern web applications using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. This project walks through the process of setting up a scalable application, building reusable UI components, implementing routing, and integrating external APIs â€” all while maintaining clean and organized code.

## Implementation Guide
1. Initialize the project using Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
2. Set up basic routing using the Pages Router
3. Start with reusable UI components like Card and Button
4. Progress to more complex components such as Modal, PostCard, and UserCard
5. Build a Header component for site-wide navigation
6. Integrate and display data from the JSONPlaceholder API
7. Continuously test components and pages throughout development

## Expected Outcomes
* A complete and functional Next.js web application
* Modular, reusable components built with TypeScript best practices
* Seamless navigation through multiple pages using Next.js routing
* Real-time data integration from an external API
* A responsive, mobile-friendly UI built with Tailwind CSS
* Clean, maintainable, and scalable codebase
